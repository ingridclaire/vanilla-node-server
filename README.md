## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm start
```


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please follow this process:

1. Fork this repo

2. Clone *your forked* repo from your github page

3. After cloning, in your terminal switch directories to this repo:

```bash
cd vanilla-node-server
```

4. Before making ANY changes, set the upstream in order to keep in sync with this original repo and avoid merge conflicts:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ingridclaire/vanilla-node-server.git
git pull upstream main
```

5. Once the previous step is done, and your fork is up to date, you will now create a branch where you will write your code. Do not include the angle brackets < > around your branch name.

```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name-here>
```

6. Open the repo in your code editor and make your changes.

7. Add and commit your changes to your branch. Before adding, you can verify that you are checked out to your branch:

```bash
git branch
```

&emsp;Your branch should be starred.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "write a short, meaningful message about your changes"
```

8. Push changes to this branch on *your* repo. After you complete the first push to your repo, you will not need to include the -u flag anymore.

```bash
git push -u origin <your-branch>
```

&emsp; Replace \<your-branch\> with the new branch name you created (don't include angle brackets)

9. Open a pull request on the github page for *your fork*. Your new branch should be merging into main. Your PR will be checked and merged ASAP if there are no issues. If any issues exist, you will get a response outlining what needs to be fixed.
